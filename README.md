## Problem Statement
Aid for the blind

## The Idea
Our idea is to develop a product using hardware + software pipeline which would aid the blind in knowing about their surrondings.The most common problem faced by the blind  people is the inefficiency in understanding the surrondings .This often leads to major/minor accidents which sometimes become fatal.Our idea proposes to solve this problem using technology.

## Implementation details

We propose to solve the problem by using the conept of image captioning along with a basic tect to speech code.
The real time image being displayed onto a server by an IOT device will be fetched by the webapp, upon proper command from the user.This fetched image will then be transfered onto the pre-trained and pre-loaded ML code present in the sever connected to the web-app.The code will then output an MP3 sound file. This marks the completion of chain of events for one image.Similarly for other images also the same pipeline will be followed.

## Technologies Used
